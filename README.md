# Point_of_Sale
This is a prototype of Point of Sale for a clothing brand using C++. This project helps save 2-3 minutes of searching the inventory by using AVL Trees.
The program reads the entire inventory as soon as opening and saves it in an AVL Tree, then when exiting the program it makes the changes back to the file from the AVL Tree.
